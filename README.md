# DETR-Demo (DEâ«¶TR: End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers)

We replace the full complex hand-crafted object detection pipeline with a Transformer, and match Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50, obtaining 42 AP on COCO using half the computation power (FLOPs) and the same number of parameters. Inference in 50 lines of PyTorch.
